Democratizing access to Silicon Valley:

Silicon Valley, the global center for innovative technology. Home to a large concentration of high tech companies that create and spread a culture of Techno - Optimism here in the bay. Techno- Optimism promotes this notion that advancements in Science and Technology benefits society and all citizens involved. 
  

I didn’t know the extent to which communities at large can be so embedded in a culture centered around technology because of their proximity to it until I moved here at twenty-five. A novice in coding, I impulsively enrolled, and by the grace of God and the good staff at admissions, was admitted to Make School. A computer science college for the 21st century here in the heart of San Francisco. For the first time in my life, I was immersed in a community of “Makers”. A network of coding enthusiast, software engineers, and entrepreneurs. I now have access to an abundance of resources through incubative development by means of mentorship, peer-relationships, exposure and practice that will enable me to explore, cultivate and hone my skills and liking towards coding and technology that I did not have coming from my previous circumstance. My recent initiation into this ecosystem as a “walk-on”, inspired me to delve into my own experience as a South Sudanese - American immigrant,  502 miles away from Silicon Valley,  growing up in Southeast San Diego. A lower income minority pocket of the city.

Problem - What happens to disenfranchised individuals who exist in marginalized communities that are far beyond the reach of Silicon Valley?

Solution - D.A.S.V(democratizing access to Silicon Valley), Is an online application where young people who are enthusiastic towards STEM areas, with a particular focus in computer science, can find others with shared interests outside their immediate communities.

“When people find one another on social media, they do things.”

This application is helpful for disenfranchised individuals who come from marginalized communities where their interests are often ignored because the infrastructures, support systems and resources aren't readily available.
